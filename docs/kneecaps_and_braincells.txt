!title Kneecaps and Braincells
!contributor Kawaiitron

Spud Kawaiitron once had a bit where they would steal kneecaps and braincells for sale on the black market. They would ask Pearl for her kneecaps and braincells, attempting to remove them with a crowbar. Some other spuds joined the "tax collectors" as well, taxing any new spuds in Pearlcord upon entry.

== The Tipping War ==
During one Satisfactory stream, a war was held through Pearl's tipping jar between the "dekneecappers" and "anti-dekneecappers." Multiple tip and bit messages would be sent from both factions, one demanding the theft of Pearl's kneecaps and braincells, and the other standing against it.

== The End ==
Pearl eventually requested that the kneecap and braincell talk slow down, and eventually, it came to an end. However, once in a while, for special occassions, kneecaps and braincells may still be taxed, such as the lead tax collector (Kawaiitron)'s birthday.
