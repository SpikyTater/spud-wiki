!title = Alt+F4

On the 10th of June 2025{1}, Pearl was terraforming on stream and chat tried to explain her how to set up camera's with the Freecam mod. Someone in chat, accidentally, suggested Alt+F4+1 (in reality it's just F4+1..9). Pearl pressed these keys, not realising/remembering that pressing **Alt+F4** closes your active window. This closed her Minecraft instance and also crashed the stream for a bit.
