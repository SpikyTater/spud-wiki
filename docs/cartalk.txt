!title Car Talk
!contributor BlueStrategosJ
Pearl really loves cars. She will often spend some time in a stream talking about cars and driving. These talks have been named **Car Talk** by Chat. Any mention of cars by a game or by chat can result in a case of car talk. Pearl loves driving and even drives Karn around as he is the Passenger Princess. She has discussed her own and Karn’s cars on stream and has provided many of her personal car anecdotes. At least once, a kangaroo jumped into Pearl’s old car while she was driving. Both the kangaroo and Pearl were fine, but the car got a dent right before Pearl wanted to sell it.{1} Other driving stories include a time when she had to get Karn after his car broke down or when a driving cap fell off while driving. She has also given her opinion on other cars, traffic rules, and safety precautions. If you ask her for driving advice, she will likely give you some help. Pearl really loves talking about cars.
Pearl also loves car games. She frequently plays racing games and likes race sections in variety games. One of her first was GTA, which she played for the car gameplay and not for its crime aspects. She generally prefers games with good driving mechanics and doesn’t rate arcade race games highly. Therefore, never ask Pearl about Mario Kart as she dislikes its mechanics and never got into it too much. Instead, she will gladly talk about all the different driving games she and Karn have played. (They will often race each other in such games, and she mostly beats him.){2} Pearl, therefore, doesn’t love all car games, just the majority. 
Overall, Pearl really loves cars and talking about cars.
