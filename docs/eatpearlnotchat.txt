== Prelude - The Cooking Stream ==
During Pearl and Karn's cooking stream, the two of them prepared a dish involving potatoes - US! THE SPUDS! We were boiled, mashed, and eaten! We decided to start a soft revolution, but this would not develop further until much, much later...

== The Start ==
On December 12th, 2024, Pearl did a bonus Plate Up! stream with TangoTek. Our bloodlust and desire for revenge for the cooking stream resulted in a new hashtag: \#EatPearl. Pearl managed to completely ignore the revolution, so we pushed on and on. But with such a long-lived revolution, mistakes were bound to happen...

== The Evolution of the Revolution ==
During one instance of typing the \#EatPearl hashtag, spud Kawaiitron made a small typo: \#EarPearl. They tried desperately to get chat back on track once other spuds starting using this accidental hashtag, but \#EarPearl became the new norm. It was then that Pearl finally noticed, while chat was mocking Kawaii's typo... *sigh...*
Kawaiitron then blamed others for their mistakes, as the hashtag developed further into \#EatPearlsEar.

== Chaos. ==
Chat turned the hashtag into \#EatKawaii. They protested, as they insisted their demon flesh was not appetizing, but Pearlchat's "yes, and" principle could not be stopped.
More hashtags came forward, including:
>\#WeAteTangoPearlsEarIsNext (and simply \#PearlsEarIsNext)
>\#EatPearlNotChat (one that came into being earlier, but was repurposed to refer to chat cannibalizing themselves, rather than Pearl and Karn eating us)
>\#EatTheMods
>\#PetTheMods (to lull them into a false sense of security, then eat them)
>\#EatPearlsFriendList
>\#EatTheScreen
>\#EatEverything

== A Happy Ending...? ==
Kawaii decided that they finally had enough and ate another spud so so cutely. But in the demon's heart, they felt a new feeling... they were sated. They had a moment of clarity: Perhaps eating and eating was not the answer? Perhaps, if they gave up the fight, they could bring about a new era? Yes, perhaps they needed a place where they could set aside their differences and eat in harmony... what if Pearl and Tango opened a place where they could feed the hungry chatters? A... a "restaurant..." but not just any. They can call it... "Wokka Wokk-" oh, wait, the restaurant died. And thus the fight continued.
...Bad ending unlocked. \#WeCantEatTheResturauntSoLetsEatPearl

== The End ==
The \#EatPearl hashtags continued for some time after the Plate Up stream, but eventually, Pearl told us to chill out with the weirder hashtags, and thus, the cannibalism hashtags (mostly) came to an end.
