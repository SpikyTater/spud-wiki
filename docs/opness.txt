!title OP-ness
!contributor waarisdetaart

When discussing villagers during a stream, someone in chat mentioned that they are too OP. Because Mojang at the time was working on a potential villager rework, Pearl responded to this that they're "trying to remove their OP-ness".{1} Ouch. Sounds like it might hurt...

When chat pointed Pearl's word choices out to her{2}, Pearl called the chat "terrible" and later she threw 1 diamond ore into lava as punishment. 

Later on in the stream, after Pearl was done playing Hermitcraft TCG with xBCrafted, someone in chat pointed out that Pearl put 43 cards in her deck, while she was only allowed 42. Pearl corrects her mistake, and then someone (who may or may not be the author of this article) said "43 cards would be too much OP-ness" in chat, not actually expecting Pearl to fall for it and read it out loud. Pearl, the good chat-reader that she is, does read this out loud and punishes chat by burning another 2 diamond ores.
