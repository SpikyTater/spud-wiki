!title Rivalry with Oli
!contributor BlueStrategosJ

Oli/TheOrionSound is a great fan of Pearl's game Peardle/Dye-duction and is caught in an intense rivalry with chat over it. Oli tries to play Peardle every week on Pearl's stream, and chat has made it a weekly goal to get a better score than him. When Oli is unable to attend a stream, chat will claim an automatic victory for that week. Most other times, chat is able to beat Oli and will happily celebrate the win. In the rare cases of Oli winning, there are suspicions of cheating. Meanwhile chat has been begrudgingly accepting of draws.
Oli has tried to defend his poorer performances by claiming that he is effectively competing with hundreds of chatters. What he doesn't understand is that chat is a collective Spudmind with only one braincell, which gets lent to whoever guesses the right word. 
Occasionally, other people play Peardle and the chatters will celebrate anytime these guests win against Oli. This has been common with El/Soupforeloise (Oli's girlfriend), as chat loves to hold El's victories over Oli. Another constant of Oli's Peardle sessions are people (cough cough Gem) complaining to Pearl about either Oli being late or Oli stealing Pearl away from conversations. Chat finds these occasions thoroughly hilarious. One such case was Gem and Oli crashing out on Pearl's stream, with Pearl playing the overwhelmed middle-woman.{1} In another occasion, Oli played Peardle on Gem's stream as Pearl was unavailable.{2}
The rivalry with Oli has been the cause for several hashtags, like \#EatOli and \#BlameOli. These hashtags have been used occasionally outside the Peardle context when Oli does something to slight chat. A common cause is Oli smearing chat's honour or Oli being late to Pearl's streams. Chat on occasion also likes to make fun of Oli, for example for not delivering the Peardle music.
