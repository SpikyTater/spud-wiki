**LAMP** is a chat phenomenon that started during Pearl's Plate Up stream collab with Tango that took place on July 11th 2025{1}. A chatter's autocorrect changed a simple "LMAO" to "LAMP" which, thanks to the mysterious ways of chat, quickly blew out of proportions.

Almost immediately a multitude of spuds started repeating the accursed word over and over again, then praises towards LAMP began to be heard and soon enough a cult formed. Indeed, normal stuff.

##Thankfully## Sadly Pearl did not share chat's appreciation for the LAMP and asked chat to calm down.

Thus the legend of the LAMP began and ended in a very short time span.
