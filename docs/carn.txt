Pearl likes cars and therefore likes playing and streaming driving games. **Carn** was born from one such streamed game, **Pacific Drive**. During the stream, several chatters missed Karn and decided to name Pearl’s car in the game **Carn** (or **Kar**) as a pun. When Pearl later asked for a car name, Chat unanimously and innocently decided to use Carn.
What Chat didn’t know was that Pearl’s mind was deep in the gutter that day. Instead of accepting the name, Pearl accused chat of being naughty and said: “We cannot call the car Carn. Because it would be like me saying I am getting into Carn when I enter the car.” {1} Apparently, Pearl wasn’t aware of the Streisand effect, as chat ignored her wishes for another car name and insisted on Carn.
Encouraged by Pearl’s own dirty mind, some chatters made Carn jokes for the rest of the stream. For example: “Carn got all banged up.” As cars are all female, Chat decided that Carn officially uses she/her. When Karn (with a K) came by Pearl’s room at the end of the stream, Pearl couldn’t stop herself and told him about Carn. She added that she didn’t want to name it Carn as she would be entering Carn then.
Karn was unable to answer to that and wisely retreated to his own stream. Since that stream, some chatters have tried to name Pearl’s vehicles in other games also Carn, but as of now, they have been unsuccessful.
