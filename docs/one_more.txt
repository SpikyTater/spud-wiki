!title One More
!contributor waarisdetaart

Pearl loves playing (mini)games. She can get competitive with these, not exactly against other people, but mostly against herself. She always wants to improve herself, whether it is doing a faster run of Metro Mayhem, a higher score run of Hungry Hermits, or a deeper dive into the Decked Out Dungeon. This can result in streams where Pearl will just play a certain (mini)game for the entire stream, often going overtime on her streams as well. 

When the stream is supposed to end, or when Pearl feels like she should stop, she'll often tell chat that she will do "one more" game/run/round. Often, it does not go exactly to plan and she'll play at least a couple more. And then one more. And maybe one more. Oh but that one, it didn't go so well, she died early, so let's do one more. Oh wow, someone else joined the server that she can play with! Let's do just one more round with them. Oh, now they're getting into it! Just one more then... Oh wait, how is it 10am already...?

But you know, she is not addicted and can stop whenever she wants. She  just doesn't want to stop...
