# TheOnionSound

(Written by <span class="tw-name col-blue">BlueStrategosJ</span>)

On the 10th of July 2025, several YouTubers were invited to a F1 Sim Racing Event in London that was also [streamed on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2502699893?t=0h31m5s). Among them were several of Pearl’s friends, like Grian, Jimmy/SolidarityGaming and **Oli**/**TheOrionSound**.

For unknown reasons the announcer at the event was unable to pronounce any of their names correctly and created completely new ones. The mispronounced names were so bad that on the following day even Pearl complained in her offline chat over them. One highlight was the turning of TheOrionSound into **TheOnionSound**.

Chat has started to adopt this version as a humorous way to refer to Oli, especially during situations were Oli gets mocked by chat and/or Pearl. Occasionally TheOnionSound also gets shortened to Onion.
