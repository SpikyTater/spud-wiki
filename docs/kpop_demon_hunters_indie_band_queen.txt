**"Have you seen K-Pop Demon Hunters?"** or **"Have you heard about the indie band called Queen?"** were recurring questions in the livestream chat on the 9th July 2025. At first people asked about K-Pop Demon Hunters{1} because they were curious if Pearl watched it and how she liked it, but later after multiple people asked this question not knowing someone else asked it prior, it became a joke among chatters to ask this question.

== Indie Band Queen ==

The question about the "indie" band [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band) Queen]]{2} started appearing shortly after the fist time KDH was mentioned, when Pearl admitted she doesn't know many band names. As a result if someone asked about KDH another chatter would ask **"Have you heard about the indie band called Queen?"**.

== Fun Fact: ==

This happened in the same livestream where fun was banned. :\]
