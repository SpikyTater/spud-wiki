TLDR: **Larry** is a rubber chicken from the game Dark Hours that turned into an emote on Pearl's Twitch. Larry is an immortal being that transcends time and space. The emote is considered a good luck charm. 

On the 31st of January 2025 Pearl streamed a new spooky heist game called Dark Hours. She played with Karnasas, RichardThornton and OrionSound. In this game you and your team take on a heist while you're being hunted by supernatural beings. If one of the monsters kills you, your teammates can revive you if they find you in a short enough time period (about 45 seconds). At some point{1}, Pearl finds a rubber chicken in the house they're in. She proudly shows this chicken to the others and exclaims: "Do you like Larry!?" Larry returns somewhere on the map with every new round, therefore chat started calling Larry an immortal being that transcends time and space.

Later, the group is doing a heist while being hunted by the Blind Ghoul, one of the supernatural beings in Dark Hours that cannot see but can hear very well. By throwing Larry, Pearl is able to distract the Blind Ghoul and get away from it. Pearl and chat grow very attached to Larry very quickly and Pearl does whatever she can to keep Larry with her at all times, even choosing to save it before saving her friends.

Larry has since then stayed a huge hit within Pearl's chat, some chatters were even requesting a Larry emote. On the 8th of Febuary someone posted an artwork of a Larry emote on Pearl's Discord. With permission of the artist, Pearl has turned this into an emote on Twitch (pearlieLarry). The Larry emote is a good luck charm: chat uses it in situations where Pearl needs some extra luck, such as when trying to get Wind Burst books from Ominous Vaults or when opening Pok√©mon card packs. Another time when the emote is used is while playing spuddle, in this case Larry is used to indicate a letter that is correct but in the wrong spot (ie. yellow letters in Wordle). When a guessed word has 2 yellow letters, the second "Larry" is called Larrot, and the third, fourth and fifth ones are called Larissa, Laura and Lawrence respectively.

Even the world of music is not safe from Larry's greatness. Chatter CelticJax has published on the 1st of March 2025 a song inspired by everybody favorite rubber chicken.{2}

For the Hermitcraft 2025 Gamers Outreach charity event, Pearl wanted to auction of a piece of art made by herself, similarly to what she did for the 2024 event. However, this time she wanted to make something specifically for this event, so she decided to draw something on stream. After some discussion with chat, it was decided that Pearl would draw Larry holding a sword in its beak. It took Pearl about 11 hours over 2 streams{3}{4} to finish depicting the magnificence of Larry. After the artwork was finished Pearl also bought two actual rubber chickens, one to give away with the artwork and another to keep for herself. Pearl sometimes squeaks this Larry when she needs some extra luck, in addition to chat spamming the Larry emote.
