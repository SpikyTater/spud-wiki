During her streams of the game Satisfactory Pearl often encountered and killed creatures called Stingers, also known as spiders. Eventually chat started to use the hashtag #DeathToSpiders. To counter this, a few chatters started #JusticeForSpiders. This chat civil war reached a new stage when in the Stream “Oil Power!”, Pearl murdered a peaceful spider while building her oil power plant. The distraught chat named the murdered spider “Jerome-Lucas Bill Spiderton”, created a backstory of a parent that is returning to the kids and started the hashtag #JusticeForJerome-LucasBillSpiderton. A martyr was born. When Pearl shortly after killed more spiders, the hashtag got lengthened to #JusticeForJerome-LucasBillSpidertonAndHisFriendsAndFamily.

From that point onwards, a dedicated group of chatters sent in #JusticeForJerome-LucasBillSpidertonAndHisFriendsAndFamily whenever Pearl killed a spider. They always got immediately countered by a similarly dedicated group of chatters sending in #DeathToSpiders. This spider war expanded beyond the satisfactory stream and has even been spotted in Minecraft streams. In a first for Pearlchat, this civil war has even led to the creation of a fanfiction dedicated to the war, named [“In the midst of spider” by the chatter gpanada](https://www.tumblr.com/gpanada/789425307721564160/in-the-midst-of-spider?source=share).

A likely reason for the intensity of the civil war was Pearl’s spree of mass murder in Satisfactory, with even completely innocent creatures like land whales and space dogs among the unfortunate victims.
