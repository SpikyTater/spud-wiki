In March 2025, PearlescentMoon blew the world away with a series of incredible pictures of her trips to Stockholm, Sweden and London, UK. Among these were one of Pearl on a throne with a diamond sword in Stockholm, and several of her in a wonderful dress at the Minecraft Movie Premiere.
Both sapphic and non-sapphic chatters were amazed by their beautiful streamer, and many compliments were sent towards Pearl. This was intensified when, during a conversation about Pearl's new great-looking coat from Sweden, Gem referred to Pearl as a supermodel, which was echoed by chat.{1}
As Pearl denied these compliments and grew uncomfortable with the calls of supermodel, some chatters combined her previous association with soup with supermodel to create the hashtag **\#SouperModel**. 
Nowadays, when chatters want to compliment Pearl's looks or want to reminisce about the Sweden and UK trips, this hashtag gets often used.
