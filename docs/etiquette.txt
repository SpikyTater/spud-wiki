**Chat Etiquette** is the set of behaviours which help maintain a comfortable streaming experience for both the streamer and the viewer. Pearl, like most streamers, has her rules [[https://www.twitch.tv/pearlescentmoon/about listed in her Twitch channel]].

This is one of the few serious articles in this whole wiki, in which both explicitly written rules and so-called "unspoken rules" will be expounded upon. While mainly focused on Pearl's channel, these rules will help in most other channels as well.

== Official Pearlchat Rules ==

These have been copied and pasted from Pearl's [[https://www.twitch.tv/pearlescentmoon/about about page]].

=== No toxicity in chat ===

Don't be offensive towards Pearl or anybody else, simply don't be a toxic [Nugget | butt-nugget]. Jokes are welcome, but do not to go overboard with them and make sure that it is easily understandable that you are joking. If asked to stop, then stop immediately. Anything to do with racism, homophobia or any other kinds of discriminatory behaviour is *never* considered a joke.

=== Be respectful to your fellow viewers ===

For most watchers, Pearl is a comfort streamer. That's why you absolutely shouldn't make others uncomfortable with you messages. Before posting a message, think about how you would feel if that same message was directed to you. Of course even things you wouldn't find offensive, others may sometimes take offense in. In case others get offended, simply say sorry, explain yourself and move on.

=== No advertising ===

Do not promote yourself or your content in any way, unless it is useful to what is going on in the stream.

=== Avoid backseat gaming unless asked for ===

First of all, backseat gaming is when a viewer is trying to play the game for the streamer. While there are streamers that encourage backseat gaming, Pearl does not like it at all. When she wants help for something she is going to **explicitly** ask chat for help: "Chat, help me with this!". Sometimes while playing a game, especially new games during [Pearlchat on Fridays | variety stream day], you may listen to her say "OMG how does this thing work, how can I do this?!": this is not her asking for help, this is her talking by herself and thinking about it.
Even saying things like "I hate this guy" towards a certain character in a game you have played can  be considered backseating.

== Common sense rules ==

Because sometimes it's best to write all rules. This have been written by memory and, well, by searching on google. {1}{2}

=== Be respectful of the streamer's privacy ===

Pearl's age in known, and, jokes aside, we know she is a straight woman, she lives with her boyfriend [[https://www.twitch.tv/karnasas Karn]] and two cats, Olive and [Nugget] in Victoria, Australia. That's it. Don't ask other questions. Pearl is an extremely nice person, but she has, for very good reasons, an extremely low tolerance when privacy-invading questions are asked.
Don't bother her about her name, precise location and other such questions. The following rule could have been included in this one, but author feels it is necessary to put emphasis to it.

=== No questions about marriage and/or pregnancy ===

This one shouldn't need an explanation, but I'll add one since it seems many people lack basic politeness. If you feel this is an obvious rule, feel free to go on to the next one; if not...
**THE HECK?** These are questions you shouldn't ask *anybody* in real life, let alone a complete stranger on the internet.

=== English only ===

Pearl is an English streamer with an audience from all over the world that understands English. Don't write sentences in other languages, other than very simple ones (for example Hola! Ciao! and so on).

=== No swear words ===

Pearl is a family friendly streamer and swear words aren't allowed in her chat. Do not try to get around this rule by slightly modifying the words.

=== No spamming ===

Don't spam the same message multiple times in a row in a short amount of time. And don't use all caps unless it's for a very short message or as a part of a collective joke. Same thing for emotes: it's fine when there's many people spamming them, but only for a short period of time.

=== Can I join? ===

Unless specifically stated in the stream title that Pearl is going to pay games with viewers, then no.

=== No calling out lurkers ===

If you see somebody in the viewers list, e.g. Grian or even your best friend John Smith III, and they aren't participating in chat, **DO NOT** call them out. Let them watch/listen to the stream and chill.

=== Listen to Pearl/mods ===

If Pearl or her moderation team (displayed by a white sword on a green background badge in chat) asks you to stop doing something, you stop immediately.

=== Try to keep on topic ===

This one isn't a very strict rule, but it's never wrong to follow it.

=== Do not force interactions ===

"hI poErl, pRAnk giRiaN!". No.

=== Do not mention viewer count ===

Don't make the streamer anxious about it.

=== Pearl pls sleep it's late ===

Pearl is an adult who works night shifts, i.e. streaming. She knows when she is tired and does not need you to remind her. She also knows when to eat and drink water.

=== Ur so tall PreAl, r U auSSie? ===

Yes, she is tall. She knows. We know. She is tall, pretty and Aussie. No need to ask.

=== No links in chat ===

Twitch automatically parses URLs in Pearl's chat messages and deletes what it deems as a link.

=== Do not comment on appearance/voice ===

Never say something on the lines of "You look/sound tired". This is extremely disrespectful and many other streamers will ban you just for this message on sight. Yes, you may make nice compliments, but do not go overboard with them and generally do not make it weird.

=== Do not comment about other streamers ===

If somebody goes live, you do not need to announce it to chat, even if they are Pearl's friend, unless Pearl was asking for them. Do not say you are going to watch another streamer, just do it without posting rude messages.

=== No shipping ===

As mentioned earlier, Pearl has a boyfriend and does not like being shipped.

=== No announcing sad news ===

If something bad has happened (death of somebody famous, death of a friend of the streamer, catastrophe in other countries, whatever really) **DO NOT SAY IT**.

=== No trauma dumping ===

Just keep the stream vibes positive.

=== When's the season ending? ===

We do not know, Pearl does not know. Even if she were to know, she wouldn't say it unless it was previously officially announced.

=== No personal info in chat ===

This includes your age, your name, your location. In short be careful with anything you write, because once it's out there you can't take it back.
