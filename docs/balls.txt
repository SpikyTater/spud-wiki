**Balls** are a common feature in Pearl’s content. Almost every stream and several videos will include some mention of balls or other round objects, to which the audience will raise calls of **“Balls!”** This then leads to either Pearl or Chat accusing the other of being in the gutter. There are too many cases of balls and related jokes in Pearl’s content-creation history to be presented in full, but here are some prominent ones:

-	Pearl refers to Minecraft’s experience orbs as “balls” or “XP balls”, to the bewilderment of her audience and fellow CCs. Famously, she accuses other Hermits of leaving “their balls behind”, when she finds XP orbs at the Enderman XP farm on Hermitcraft. This raises eyebrows among her viewers with accusations that she isn’t as innocent as everybody thinks.
-	During the Just Catting stream in 2024, Karn wanted to seat himself beside Pearl on the floor after getting his lightsaber to show off. He moved some cat toy balls out of the way to sit down and said: “Let’s not sit on the balls!” Clearly misunderstanding poor, innocent Karn, Pearl threw him a dirty look until he showed her one of the cat toys he was referring to. This launched both Pearl and Karn into an embarrassed laughing fit, with the stream audience enjoying the whole show.{1}
-	The PORK playthrough of Pico Park 2 is filled with deranged chaos and sus moments (like the many sucking jokes in Level 3-3).{2} This descended fully into ball jokes in Level 10-3, where the players had to juggle a ball across a room. Something in this stage unleashed the naughty side of Pearl and Richard as they kept joking and laughing about balls. For example, Pearl said: “What, you can’t handle some balls?” to Karn, while Richard expressed interest in touching the ball at least once.{3} From this stream, Richard’s association with Balls was born.
-	Pearl’s Split Fiction streams are littered with ball moments, as the game is chock-full of balls. Chat, Pearl and even Karn made occasional mentions and jokes about the different balls, with Chat especially spamming “Balls” comments. This reached a high point when, in the third-to-last chapter, Pearl and Karn had to play as some balls. Pearl even says, “Apparently balls and me are just meant to be together,” before accusing Karn of saying “Balls” with too much enthusiasm. Both of them embraced the Balls after that.{4}

==Snowballs==

Pearl has gained a certain reputation with snowballs after her trip to the Mojang Office in Sweden in 2025. As recorded in Grian’s video on the visit, Pearl, Grian and Gem had a snowball fight on a free evening. For Pearl, this was her first experience with powdery snow and her first snowball. In a hilarious moment, Pearl failed to hit Grian point-blank with a snowball.{5} Since then, chatters and fellow YouTubers tease Pearl’s throwing skills. Anytime snowballs or the topic of throwing things come up, Pearl will get reminded by them of the snowball fight in Stockholm, most of the time accompanied by Pearl’s mock protests.
