!title Pearlchat on Fridays
!contributor BlueStrategosJ

Pearl usually streams various variety games in her Friday streams, which often result in a smaller but very dedicated group of Pearl chatters that are used to each other. Additionally, certain Spuds that miss streams on weekdays are able to join the Friday stream.
This mixture can result in either an incredibly wholesome, cozy atmosphere or in chat jumping headfirst into the gutter with naughty jokes (usually both). Especially the presence of certain chatters like Kawaiitron or CelitcJax can result in a wave of BOP emotes to punish their naughtiness.
Of course, Pearl and her fellow players, as well as the variety games, contribute to this atmosphere of silliness and coziness.
Famously, Pearl singlehandedly started the Smile joke in a Friday stream of the game Squirreled Away. 
Similarly, many of Pearl, Karn or others's quotes get regularly taken out of context (if there ever was a context).
But Pearl has created and managed a great community that stays wholesome and welcoming even if it likes to joke. The only recommendation is to come in on a Pearl Variety Stream and join the fun.
