!title The Mayo Game
!contributor BlueStrategosJ

During a conversation about different games they have played, Oli was provoked by Pearl’s dislike of Mario Kart to take a look at her Steam account. To his horror, he discovered that Pearl had only played a bit of Belatro and had not touched other popular games he liked, even while owning them through Humble Bundle. Pearl’s defence of game choices was swept aside by Oli when he discovered Pearl’s apparent fondness for idle clicker games.{1} One stood especially apart: My Name is Mayo.
Called the Mayo Clicker game by Pearl and Chat, it is a game about the clicking adventure simulating the real-life tapping of a Mayo jar.{2} A laughing, embarrassed Pearl blamed her bored teenage self for not only finishing the game, but also getting all the achievements. Supposedly, she had a lot of time to procrastinate in her teen years. Pearl explained afterwards that she still maintains vague memories of the game and doesn’t consider it good.

Encouraged by Oli, Chat demanded an immediate Mayo game stream from Pearl. Oli even called it a Nostalgia stream, but Pearl refused. She instead pointed out that Chat already received a Minesweeper Stream, which pacified Chat for the moment. But since that day, chatters will occasionally suggest My Name is Mayo as a game for the next Variety Stream. (Perhaps she will actually play that game again)
