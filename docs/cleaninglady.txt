Pearl is a very clean and organized person. There is nothing that she likes more than having an organized and clean inventory and base. Therefore, the hermits with their many chaotic chest monsters have caused Pearl great pain. To deal with this issue, she decided to build the trash shop “Twinkly Trash” {1}, start a cleaning service, and name herself the server’s **Cleaner Lady** (later changed to **Cleaning Lady**) in HC S9 {2}. She also created a Cleaning Lady skin that became her main skin of S9 {3}. By hiring out her cleaning services and creating garbage bins, she hoped to create a cleaner Hermitcraft Server. Among her customers was GoodTimesWithScar, whose disorganization has garnered him server-wide notoriety. As part of her payment, Scar even pranked her with a special Chest Monster {4}. Overall, the success of the Cleaning Lady was undeniable, as she even got Grian to organize his storage, while Scar hired her as the official cleaner of Scarland. From the contents of her garbage bins, Pearl created her first Hermitcraft mini-game: **Bin-Go**.

While the Cleaning Lady was retired with the end of S9, Pearl’s interest in cleanliness has not. She still likes to organize her storages, and the chaotic messes of the other hermits will still cause her pain. Sometimes, the Cleaning Lady will return from retirement to help the Postmaster. And anytime there is a mess, or Pearl is cleaning, chat calls for the Cleaning Lady. As Pearl is also an orderly person in real life and often does house chores, chatters have also called Pearl an “Irl Cleaning Lady”.

== Storage rooms in S10 ==

Pearl likes to build storage rooms to keep her bases clean and moves them if they get too small. In S10, she had a starter storage under her starter house and later moved her stuff to a bigger storage room. But while moving the stuff over, Pearl decided that the new place “didn’t spark joy” and embarked on the construction of another storage room above her current one. She was happy with the results and promised to move the storage soon. Gem found the whole moving affair funny and built a secret bedroom in the new storage. Months later, Pearl still hadn’t moved the storage, which caused chatters to joke that the new storage room will only get used in the last episode of S10 {5}. On the 20th August 2025 (a year after its construction), Pearl finally moved into her new storage room on a stream {6}. (Chat already jokes that Pearl is going to build Storage Room Nr. 4 soon.)
