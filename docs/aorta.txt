Aorta was born out of a discussion between Pearl and her Chat over Peardle words. On the question from Pearl about difficult Wordle words, a chatter answered with the word Aorta. Pearl agreed on the difficulty of the word but remarked that she cannot use it anymore as chat is aware of it now. Chat denied being able to remember it and tried to convince Pearl to set Aorta as the next Peardle word. But Pearl refused. Every Peardle after this point, chat would jokingly suggest Aorta as a guess in the hope that they could win a round in one go. But Pearl rarely allowed Aorta to be the starter and has never set it as a Peardle word. This has even led early chatters to obfuscate their real starter by pretending to propose Aorta.
A certain chatter has developed an especially devoted fondness for Aorta, suggesting it as a starter without fail and shouting Aorta at random moments in chat. To both entertain and make fun of this chatter, Aorta has been used several times as both a starter and final word in Spuddle. Additionally, anytime a blood vessel or something similar makes an appearance in a Pearl stream, both this specific chatter and the rest of Chat will shout Aorta. For a while, the joke even existed that Aorta was basically the summoning incantation for this chatter.
