!title Spider War 1

During her streams of the game Satisfactory Pearl often encountered and killed creatures called Stingers, also known as spiders. Eventually chat started to use the hashtag #DeathToSpiders. To counter this, a few chatters started #JusticeForSpiders. This chat civil war reached a new stage when in the Stream "Oil Power!", Pearl murdered a peaceful spider while building her oil power plant. The distraught chat named the murdered spider "Jerome-Lucas Bill Spiderton", created a backstory of a parent that is returning to the kids and started the hashtag #JusticeForJerome-LucasBillSpiderton. A martyr was born. When Pearl shortly after killed more spiders, the hashtag got lengthened to #JusticeForJerome-LucasBillSpidertonAndHisFriendsAndFamily.

From that point onwards, a dedicated group of chatters sent in #JusticeForJerome-LucasBillSpidertonAndHisFriendsAndFamily whenever Pearl killed a spider. They always got immediately countered by a similarly dedicated group of chatters sending in #DeathToSpiders. This spider war expanded beyond the satisfactory stream and has even been spotted in Minecraft streams. In a first for Pearlchat, this civil war has even led to the creation of a fanfiction dedicated to the war, named "In the midst of spider"{1} by chatter g_panada.

A likely reason for the intensity of the civil war was Pearlâ€™s spree of mass murder in Satisfactory, with even completely innocent creatures like land whales and space dogs among the unfortunate victims.
