**Dragons** are Pearl’s favourite fantasy creatures and one of her most common art motives. She likes drawing and building dragons, with her most successful Minecraft video being a creative build of a gorgeous dragon.{1} Commonly, dragons are called **Durgan** by both Chat and Pearl. The origin of that word is unknown to Pearl, but might be a fun nickname for dragons from a meme.{2}
Other people have remarked on Pearl’s love for dragons, for example, Karn during their Split Fiction streams. During that playthrough, Pearl was incredibly impressed by the designs of the dragon story and took a lot of screenshots of all the dragon stuff. While she was moderately disappointed by her dragon’s move set, she grew to love him. That dragon was named **Doink** by chat, while Karn’s was named **Chuck**.{3} For Pearl, dragons are essential for proper fantasy and necessary for good fantasy games.
