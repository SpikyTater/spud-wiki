Usually chat spams **\#LetPearlSwear** when something they deem worthy of being cursed happens on stream. This is just for fun and games, as Pearl is a family friendly streamer and she will never heed our plea for her to swear.

But accidents happen...

Like in a stream of 'The Quarry'{1} where, while reading the game's sentences, she accidentally said a swear word. Chat of course noticed and **\#PearlFinallySwore**, another hashtag, was thus born.
