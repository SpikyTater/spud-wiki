!title Birthday Tradition
!contributor BlueStrategosJ

The Spuds have a tradition of sending Twitch subs and bits to Pearl on their birthdays. The tradition started with a few chatters sending such gifts to Pearl to make her aware of their birthdays and share their birthday with everybody. Since then, chatters have kept sharing the joy of their birthday with Pearl and chat by generously gifting either subs or sending bits. While Pearl has been grateful for the gifts, she always demands that the birthday chatters spend their money on themselves instead of gifting. But she misunderstands the tradition as spending money on their favourite streamer is also spending money on themselves.

For her 28th birthday, Pearl made the tradition official by gifting chat several subs to the collective protest of the subs. Pearl has not yet accepted that this action has been an official endorsement of the tradition and denies its existence. The only way to teach her is to continue the tradition. To accomplish this task, chat managed the biggest hype train of Pearlâ€™s Twitch history for her 29th birthday.
