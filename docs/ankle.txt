!title Pearl's Ankle
!contributor BlueStrategosJ

Feet and **Ankles** have been a common topic in the Shiny Duo Rambles between Pearl and Gem.

== The origin of Ankle Talk ==

In her last stream of 2024, Pearl and Gem discussed women's clothes and shoes, with a focus on Pearl's struggles as a tall woman to get fitting attire. Pearl complained about her too short jeans showing her ankles and mentioned that she sent a picture of her feet to Gem. Gem then remarked that she didn't see any ankles.
This quickly devolved into a discussion of ankles, feet, socks, and shoes.{1} In following streams, ankles would be occasionally mentioned by chatters when Gem appeared, or when feet become a topic.

== Kicked Ankles ==

The next phase of the ankle talk started after Pearl returned from her trip to Stockholm. While discussing a photo she took of Pearl in her new coat and looking at the ankles, Gem remarked that Pearl "kicks herself". Chat launched into a frenzied ankle conversation while Pearl vehemently denied kicking her ankles. When Pearl showed the picture of her in the coat, a chatter mentioned zooming in on the ankles, which led to Pearl denying chat the picture and asking the all-important question: "What is it with ankles when Gem is around?".{2}

== Ankle Signing ==

The grand finale of Ankle Talk came at the first day of Gamer's Outreach 2025. Pearl answered a chatter's question: "Will you let Gem sign your ankles?" As she said the question aloud, Gem noticed it and immediately jumped on the opportunity. She dragged Pearl off to her desk and, ignoring Pearl's protests and confusion, signed Pearl's ankle. Afterwards, Gem proudly presented it to stream chat. On the following day, Pearl mentioned that the signature was made with permanent marker and was not easily removed. Pearl's ankle became (kinda) famous that day.{3}{4}
