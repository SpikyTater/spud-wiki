!title The Elbow Incident
!contributor BlueStrategosJ

During his frequent IRL raids, [Karn] loves to lean on Pearl’s chair and occasionally rocking it while she is sitting on it. The reasons are unknown, but slightly annoying Pearl in a teasing manner might be a reason. One day, Pearl unintentionally got her revenge.{1} Karn was once again leaning on the chair when Pearl decided to turn towards him. This led to the armrest of the chair and Pearl’s elbow hitting Karn in his most private area. His groans of pain led to an apologetic Pearl trying to help him, while chat expressed both sympathy and amusement. Since this incident, Chat will occasionally warn Karn during his IRL raid of the danger of being close to Pearl’s elbow.
