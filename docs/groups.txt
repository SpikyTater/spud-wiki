In her long career in the content creator space, Pearl has been in many teams and duos. Some were restricted to just certain video series, like the Life Series, and her streams, while others have extended to her whole content. Here is an assortment of common group names you will encounter in Pearl's videos and streams as well as different fan spaces involving Pearl.

== Hermitcraft Teams ==

In her different Hermitcraft seasons, Pearl usually forms a group and builds her bases close to them.

=== Boatem (Pearl, Impulse, Scar, Mumbo, Grian) ===

During her debut in HC S8, Pearl joined the group of Impulse, Scar, Mumbo and Grian that decided to build a megabase around the Boatem Pole that quickly turned into the Boatem Hole. The group established both a cult around the Hole and a company with Mumbo as the CEO.

=== Soup Group (Pearl, Gem, Impulse) ===

For S9, Pearl teamed up with Gem and Impulse to form the Soup Group and create a combined megabase of their three bases. As the common ritual, the group drank suspicious stew, aka soup, together and went on adventures like overthrowing a king. The Soup Group is still commonly referenced by both fans and creators and holds together in many situations.

=== PET (Pearl, Etho, Tango) ===

In the current S10, Pearl is in a team with Etho and Tango. They are live close together and, through their combined effort, build the Hermitcraft Postal System with Pearl as its Postmaster.

== Life Series Teams ==

During the Life Series, Pearl has built several teams with the usual goal of getting her teammates to win (a notable exception being Double Life, where Tilly was her only teammate).

=== Scottage Duo (Pearl, Scott) ===

The team of Pearl's debut in Last Life was with Scott, with whom she built a cottage base, resulting in the name. Outside of Last Life, the name Galaxy Duo is preferred (more about it further down).

=== 3 Gs (Pearl, Scott, Cleo) ===

Cleo joined the Scottage later in Last Life, which resulted in a name change. Cleo became Gaslight, Scott is Gatekeep, and naturally Pearl is Girlboss. They have been called this even outside the Life Series. 

=== Divorce Quartet (Pearl, Scott, Cleo, Martyn) ===

During Double Life, Scott and Cleo decided to leave their soulmates Pearl and Martyn behind and team together. The resulting drama and occasional reluctant team-ups have resulted in the coining of the Divorce Quartet.

=== Noisy Neighbors (Pearl, BigB) ===

In Limited Life, Pearl and BigB formed the Noisy Neighbors as they tried to listen in to as many conversations as they could from their tower. Strongly associated with frogs.

=== Mounders (Pearl, Bdubs, Joel, Mumbo) ===

For Secret Life, Pearl, Bdubs and Mumbo built mounds in the middle of the server and called themselves Mounders. They later got Joel to join, as he lived on a separate mound. Each session was started with a bonding question.

=== 4Gs (Pearl, Scott, Cleo, Impulse), 5Gs (Pearl, Scott, Cleo, Impulse, BigB) ===

In Wild Life, Pearl had her biggest team yet, as the 3 Gs reformed and inducted Impulse as the fourth G (possibly standing for Girldad). Later on, BigB was adopted as the fifth G, but he was based out of a separate base.

=== Villies (Pearl, Gem, Grian) ===

In the current season of Past Life, Pearl has teamed up with Gem and Grian. They decided to be the server villains and to base in a Lighthouse of Time. As of now, they haven't been very villainous.

== Stream Teams ==

For different variety team games, Pearl will often form a lobby of her friends, which gets named by the fans.

=== PORK (Pearl, Oli, Richard, Karn) ===

Also known as the *Aussie Crew* (Oli is being an honorary Aussie): Made famous for their Pico Park 2 stream, they have played several games together and are incredibly funny. Just don't ask Richard about the Balls.

=== PISS/PIGS (Pearl, Impulse, Skizz, Scar) ===

A planned team of Pearl, Impulse, Skizz and Scar with the intention of eventually playing COD together. As of yet, they have not managed to organize it.

=== POG/the Girlies (Pearl, Oli, Gem) ===

To get Oli to like REPO, Pearl recruited Gem for several REPO sessions together. As Gem disapproves of the name POG, her preferred term, "the Girlies", should be used instead.

=== "Friends" (Pearl, Karn, False, Ren) ===

For her first experiences of REPO, Pearl teamed up with Karn, False and Ren, whom she called the Friends in her stream title. As there is no official name for them, this seems to be the best way to refer to them.

=== GIGGS (Gem, Impulse, Scar, Grian, Skizz) ===

Pearl is not officially part of GIGGS, but they are all her good friends, and she has played several games of Phasmophobia, REPO and PEAK with the team.

=== KaRen Duo (Karn, Ren) ===

Pearl's boyfriend and Pearl's boyfriend's boyfriend. Two theater kids that have finally met at GO 2025 and have been so funny in any stream where they play together with Pearl. They literally make Pearl a third wheel.

== Common Duos including Pearl ==

Over time, some of Pearl's teams and duos have gone beyond just streams and videos. These can often be found in fan spaces involving Pearl.

=== Shiny Duo (Pearl, Gem) ===

As one of Pearl's best friends, Gem and Pearl regularly play together, discuss different topics on stream and are depicted together in art. Shiny Duo comes from the association of their names with shiny stones and is meant to be a completely platonic duo. 

=== GemPearl (Pearl/Gem) ===

GemPearl is the shipping name for the duo and should not be confused with Shiny Duo.

=== Skyblings (Pearl, Grian, Jimmy) ===

Pearl and Grian are frequently depicted as siblings in fan content, as they have been friends for a long time. Because of Grian's association with birds and the sun and Pearl's association with moths and the moon, they are called Sky-Siblings or Skyblings. Jimmy as the Canary is popularly also included as part of this imagined family.

=== Sunflower Duo (Pearl, Scar) ===

Pearl and Scar are good friends, and both have strong connections with sunflowers through Empires (Pearl) and Secret Life (Scar). Scar even called Pearl Sunflower once, which caused the creation of the duo name.

=== Galaxy Duo (Pearl/Scott) ===

Pearl and Scott are old friends. Thanks to Pearl's connection to the Moon and Scott's connection to the Stars, this duo was named. Is used outside the context of Last Life in many fan spaces.

=== Wither Rose Alliance (Pearl, Gem, Fwhip, Sausage) ===

A team from Empires Season 1 that started around Gem, Fwhip, and Sausage but later included Pearl. For a prank against Jimmy, they gathered a lot of wither roses, resulting in the name.
