Pearl is a great fan of Pokémon (Pocket Monsters). Since she was a wee little Pearlo, she has been collecting Pokémon memorabilia and playing Pokémon games. She has played most of the mainline games over time and has preserved her old consoles with mostly intact saves {1}. She even streamed a playthrough of Pokémon Scarlet on Twitch (but only the first VOD is saved) {2}. With a renewed interest in Pokémon in recent times, she has started to replay older games like Sun & Moon in her free time, as well as talk a lot about Pokémon on streams. Currently, Pearl plans to play the upcoming Legends Z-A on stream. As part of the renewed interest in Pokémon came an increase in buying and collecting Pokémon cards.

== Pokémon Cards ==
Pearl likes collecting Pokémon TCG cards. Her collection started in her childhood and has continued until today. (It is not an addiction; she can stop at any time.) The collection is therefore very large and includes both English and Japanese cards that she got over time. In 2025, Pearl even started to stream card unboxings {3}, usually with one of her Pokémon-obsessed friends. She has streamed such unboxings with [!grain | Grian] {4}, [TheOnionSound | Oli] {5} and [GeminiTay | Gem].{6} At the end of these streams, Pearl normally organizes the new cards and shows off her huge card binders.

Pearl has no interest in the financial aspects of Pokémon cards and collects them only for personal interest. To save some money, she has also started to use the “Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket” app to collect cards and play some TCG games against other players. She even got Karn into it. (He has pulled a god pack in the app that totally didn’t make Pearl jealous.)

Amusingly, Pearl has a large collection of fake cards. When she was young, her mother got Pearl some off-brand Pokémon cards that turned out to be mostly fakes. As Pearl didn’t find this out until adulthood, most fake cards were distributed in her collection and had to be sorted out with the help of friends and stream chat. Both Chat and her friends have teased Pearl over the large number of fakes, with Grian remarking: “You really were into your fakes back in the day, huh? You really couldn’t tell the difference.”{7}  Even now, chatters like to tease Pearl by jokingly calling newly pulled cards fakes.

== Cubone ==
!redirect Cubone
Pearl’s favourite Pokémon are Cubone, Charizard and Absol. She chose Cubone early on for its cute looks, completely unaware of Cubone’s tragic lore.{8} Due to this lore, Pearl has been teased as a potentially tragic person. As her third-favourite Pokémon is Absol with equally tragic lore, this perception seems accurate. Even Grian has remarked that Pearl might be projecting some sadness.{9} To Pearl’s endless frustration, there is not much Cubone merch, and Cubone is one of the few original 151 Pokémon without a full art TCG card. Still, Pearl has made it her personal mission to collect all Cubone TCG cards.
