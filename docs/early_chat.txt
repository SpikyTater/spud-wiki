**Early chat**(ters) are people who hang out in chat before stream starts. They could be hanging out and talking hours before stream is supposed to start. If Pearl has not started streaming yet at 11PM AEST, the early chatters will usually start doing karaoke of the starting song Arms of Gold.

**Offline chat**(ters) are people who hang out in chat on days that Pearl does not stream. This has become more and more common since Pearl's trips at the start of 2025, when chat started hanging out and playing spuddle.

Fun fact: early chat is where the idea for this wiki was conceived!
