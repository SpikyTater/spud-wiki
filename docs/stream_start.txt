!title Stream Start
!contributor 19_meg_91

The stream starting song is "**Arms of Gold**"{1} by Tape Machines feat. Mia Pfirrman. The spuds love it so much, they won't let Pearl change it.

**"Arms of Gold" stays :\]**

This portion of the stream also features a slide show of pictures containing Pearl's favourite moments in Minecraft. On the rare occasion, this slide show consists of IRL pictures of the hermits and friends, indicating that this stream will be a facecam stream.

Once "Arms of Gold" ends, the spuds spam the "Boop" emote (pearlieBoop) so that Pearl can "see those boops happening in the chat".

After Arms of Gold ends and the boops, Pearl usually start her streams by saying the following magic spell:

>Alrighty, righty righty.
>Hello, everybody! How're y'all doing today?
>Welcome back into another beautiful stream!
>It is currently \*insert day of the week\* for the majority of the world, let's see those boops happenin' in the chat!
>Hello, hello, hello!

This formula has received a few changes in some streams.

For example, in the first stream featuring the glorious and all-knowing **LARRY**, in the midst of a barrage of larries she said:

>Let's see those boops and larries happenin' in the chat!
