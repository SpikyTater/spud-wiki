**Connor** is one of the main characters in Detroit: Become Humans and grew to be one of Pearl’s favourite characters.
For most of her streams of Detroit: Become Human, Pearl managed to keep almost all the important characters alive (o7 Kara and Alice). But she missed a few key details about Hank’s son in Hank’s house as she was occupied by reading some questionable magazines.
In the fateful confrontation between Connor, fake Connor and Hank, Pearl was unable to answer Hank’s questions and got Connor shot.{1} A heartbroken Pearl finished the playthrough and discovered that she was among the near 0% of people that got Connor killed there.{2}
Determined, she went back to find the details to save Connor and to redo the last chapters. During the attempt to save Kara and Alice, Pearl missed a random quick-time event and Connor died again.{3} Out of annoyance and love for the character, an exasperated Pearl started calling Connor "stupid" and a "stupid butt" and demanded that he should stop dying, while redoing that part.
With the new details on Hank, Pearl managed to not get Connor killed by Hank and got to the end of the game, but the game wasn’t finished with Pearl and Connor yet. A sudden last confrontation with Amanda ensued that made Pearl incredibly concerned for Connor’s life and exasperated at Connor’s willingness to die. At the end, everything was worth it as Pearl was rewarded with a Hank and Connor hug in the game credits.
Occasionally, chat brings up Connor’s death to joke about Pearl’s ability to keep characters alive (especially the part of reading magazines that got him killed).
