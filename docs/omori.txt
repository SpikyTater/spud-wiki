!title Omori Reference
!contributor Kawaiitron 

A certain chatter is *very* hyperfixated on the indie RPG game Omori, and there is a running bit where, whenever something even remotely related to Omori happens, Kawaiitron will shout, "OMORI REFERENCE-" before promptly "getting shot" by the "hyperfixation assassins." Prompts for this occurring include "stairs," "dreams," "my time," and more.
The "getting shot" bit also happens when Kawaiitron suggests that Pearl or anyone else plays Omori.
