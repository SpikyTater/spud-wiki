Editor Pearl is Pearl’s alter ego, responsible for the video editing on the channels PearlescentMoon and PearlescentMoo. This makes Editor Pearl officially Streamer Pearl’s Boss. Besides occasional appearances in videos to explain things, Editor Pearl toils quietly in the background while grumbling about her other selves. As Streamer Pearl frequently streams long and does her video content in those streams, her editor self has to sift through a lot of footage to create Pearl’s fantastic videos. Editor Pearl therefore hates Streamer Pearl and gets upset over the long streams. But recently she started to receive the help of Editor Karn, her apprentice and employee, which should hopefully help with the workload.

(There are even rumours that Editor Pearl and Editor Karn are in a relationship. But a relationship between boss and employee would be highly unprofessional, so we cannot confirm it.)

Another of Pearl’s alter egos, she made a single official appearance in Pearl’s Hermitcraft S10 Episode 32.{1} During the building time lapse, she hops and dances across the screen and instantly won the hearts and minds of the audience. While she has yet to return, the audience will occasionally ask either for her return or for her well-being.
