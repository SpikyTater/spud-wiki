On August 19th, 2025, pre-stream chat started to panic when Pearl was slightly late for stream. She reassured us that she was simply eating yogurt/yoghurt (good ol' regional spelling differences), and combined with the ongoing pre-stream gift subs, this lead to a hype train and a new hashtag: \#YogurtHypeTrain/\#YoghurtHypeTrain. Pearl was bullied - I mean, pressured - I mean, gently encouraged to start stream quickly.
