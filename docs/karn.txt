Karn is Pearl’s partner, boyfriend, “very close friend,” roommate, and third cat. (His exact description depends on how cheeky Pearl and Chat feel at the moment.) He is an Australian Twitch Streamer with his own Twitch and YouTube channels under the name Karnasas.{1} His streams are usually scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, like Pearl, but he also often does extra streams. 

Karn streams a variety of games, like Minecraft, Assassin’s Creed, Red Dead Redemption, and many, many more. He has gained a reputation for not finishing games, instead starting new ones that catch his interest. When Karn is not playing his solo games, he will stream together with Pearl and others. Karn is Pearl’s most frequent collab partner and joins her for Variety Fridays where they play duo and team games and display their great synergy. Besides collab game streams, Pearl and Karn have also done a Just Catting and a Cooking stream together.{2} 

His first public appearance was in Pearl’s HC S9 episode 31, where he did a review of Pearl’s alien base.{3} Back then, Pearl still hid his identity and called him a “close friend,” but he is scheduled to be more involved with her channel by editing Pearl’s videos and appearing in an upcoming IRL Video on PearlescentMoon. On the 1st of September 2025, Karn joined his first official creator SMP named “RLCraft. Legends of Chaos”, which successfully started with the usual amount of Karn chaos.{4} 

Karn is known for his silliness, funny voices, and long yapping sessions, which he explains with his ambition to become a future voice artist. His streams are therefore filled with both funny sound bites by him and a sound-bot playing chat-selected sounds, as well as long and deep conversations with his chat over a variety of topics. He shares Pearl’s night owl habits with a similarly fascinating sleep schedule. Apparently, he is also a good cook, as he will sometimes deliver food to Pearl while she streams. Additionally, he owns a goldfish named Peter (with attached Subnautica lore) and has Olive’s approval. (Nugget, on the other hand, has a rivalry with Karn over Pearl’s attention.)

==Karl (or PearlKarn)==

Pearl and Karn have been together since November 2022, and their relationship is going strong. (Never ask them or anyone else in real life about marriage or children! Nobody wants such questions!) While they love to be silly and cheeky with each other, they are also incredibly supportive of each other. If asked about the other, they can only say positive or funny things about each other.{5} In February 2024, Karn experienced a blackout, and Pearl offered him to move to her house. Since then, the two have been living together and are currently (late summer 2025) moving into a new house. 

Chatters have been amazed by their cuteness and synergy and have coined the term Karl to refer to the pair. A common call in the fandom has been “Ship Karl!”, which has led to several jokes of naming actual ships after “Karl”. An alternative term for the pair has been PearlKarn. Both Pearl and Karn have been accepting of the term, and Pearl has voiced a preference to be shipped with Karn in fan content. 

There have been a few cases when the pair were asked if they were related or even siblings by chatters unaware of their relationship. Usually, they get immediate and disgusted denials by Pearl and Karn. But at least once, they kept joking about the question, with Pearl even singing “Sweet Home Alabama”.

Karn has left Australia for the first time for Gamer’s Outreach 2024 to support Pearl at the event and repeated that feat in 2025. There, he has met many hermits and has struck a special connection with RenTheDog. In multiple streams after the event, Ren and Karn have proven themselves to be an incredible comedic duo. Chat sometimes calls the two even boyfriends (with Ren “kissing” Karn in one PEAK stream {6}). Even Pearl had to say that she has to share Karn with Ren now and is practically third-wheeling.{7} But don’t be afraid, Karn has to also share Pearl with Gem. Multiple times, Gem has interrupted a Pearl and Karn conversation, leading to the latter’s retreat. At Gamer’s Outreach 2025, Gem and Karn decided to settle the matter by declaring that a sharing agreement was in order.{8} (We are yet to know what the agreement fully entails.) This moment has become a favourite of Pearl, Karn, and Gem fans.

==Nicknames==

Karn has been given many nicknames by chatters and Pearl. Most famous is “Karen”, which originated from an auto-correction of “Karn” by a chatter. Since then, Karn will often be greeted by “Hi Karen.” Amusingly, people will then ask him why he is being called Karen. This has led to the command in Karn’s chat: “Helloo, I’m new to your streams from Pearl! Why do we call you Karen?”{9}

Another nickname is Catnasas. It started as a joke in Karn’s stream when a chatter redeemed a voice redemption and asked for cat noises.{10} His chat forced him later to even make cat sounds in front of Pearl.{11} This evolved further in the Just Catting stream when Karn was called Pearl’s third cat alongside Nugget and Olive. In a hilarious scene, Karn imitated a cat after hearing the name, which he supposedly immediately regretted. Catnasas has been a popular way to greet Karn by Pearl’s chat and has been dangled above Karn’s chat during Karn’s 2025 Subathon.

There have been many other nicknames for Karn, often involving a word and the ending -nasas. An example is Wizardnasas for his deep love of wizardry or Baldnasas for jokes of Karn going bald. Others change up the name Karn, like Karnio, which combines Karn and Mario. This was created when somebody called Pearl Princess Peach, which made Karn Super Mario. Sometimes Karn’s name gets compared with the US states of Arkansas and Kansas. According to him, Karnasas has nothing to do with those state names, and the whole situation is a sheer coincidence.{12}

==Mangoes Shenanigans==

Karn’s chatters are known as (Mouldy) Mangoes, and they love to both mess with their streamer and yap with him. The name originated from a joke Karn made about wanting to eat some mangoes that stayed in the fridge so long that they might have become mouldy. One thing led to another, and the chatters became mangoes. 

The mangoes have shown an utter lack of trust in the skills of their streamer, coining the term Karn Factor. This refers to his unpredictable skill and gameplay, which results in him surviving impossible situations and dying in moments at which death should be impossible. Karn’s most frequent enemy and primary source of deaths is gravity, with him dying in the weirdest ways to fall damage. Of course, this has massively inflated his death counts and fueled many gravity jokes from a chat that diligently keeps death tallies to hold their streamer accountable.{13}

As part of Karn’s stream, he allows subbed members to send sound messages into the stream. They encompass popular sounds like the Wilhelm scream to sound bites from Karn’s own stream (like #seekfluidintake). These have proven very popular with the mangoes, and they have made it their goal to jumpscare their streamer or to underscore special moments. Karn usually tries to warn new viewers to be ready for scary or weird noises by chat and will stop the feature during certain special streams, but generally, he lets the chat have their fun with the feature.

The mascot of his channel is Jacob, the sloth. Jacob is a plushie sloth and a fan favourite of Karn’s stream, with him making multiple appearances. Karn even took Jacob to Gamer’s Outreach 2025, which resulted in a hilarious scene during Permitmaster of Karn saying to Jacob: “Inspire me, Sloth!”{14}

When Karn leaves his stream for a short bit or does something that chat disagrees with, the mangoes will commence a revolution. Frequently, the revolution will not halt with his return, and both a bot command and an emote were made for revolutions. This chat behaviour is analogous with Pearlchat going “PANIC”. One-time Karn created an in-game character for Chat that was named Chatulution referencing the frequent revolution. Subsequently, Karn pushed Chatulution (and therefore) Chat off a cliff.

==Karn Raids==

Karn will often end his streams before Pearl and likes to raid her. His chat will brainstorm crazy raid messages that best describe the chaos of the stream, to the amusement of both Pearl and her chat. Before Karn moved in with Pearl, the raid was accompanied by a good night message by Karn to Pearl. Since his move, Karn will regularly raid Pearl’s stream in real life and will make an appearance in her room. This has been the cause of many funny and cute interactions between the two “roommates”, with them describing how their streams went, discussing both real life and in-game topics and generally messing with each other. 

At least once, Karn leaned on Pearl’s chair and swung it around until Pearl’s elbow hit his vulnerable area. Both chats like to remind him now to be careful around Pearl’s chair. During their conversations, both will sometimes ignore chat and get incredibly cute together. Chat has declared themselves in those situations as third wheels. Once Karn decides to leave Pearl’s stream, he will shout “Huzzah Harroo”, which Pearl answers with “Huzzah Garroo” (occasionally they switch). Chat usually chooses one or the other and wishes him Goodbye. One of Karn’s humorous habits it to leave something in Pearl’s room. This can be his phone, his lightsabre, or something completely random.{15} The result is often him trying to sneak back into Pearl’s room and shouting Huzzah Garroo again.
