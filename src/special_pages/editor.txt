Here you can test your own articles using SpudText.

== What is SpudText? ==

SpudText is a markup language created by Matty5957 for this wiki. All pages in this wiki, except this one because its complexity, have been written using it.
You can see examples of raw SpudText in all the files inside the [[https://github.com/SpikyTater/spud-wiki/tree/main/docs 'docs' directory in the repository]].

== Very interesting! How does it work? ==

OMG! Thank you SOOO much for asking! First it gets converted into a list of tokens then-

== No, I don't really care. How do I write articles using it? ==

But.. but...

== Shush and tell me how to use it ==

Ok, ok. How uncouth. Well, nevermind. Here we go.

First of all you have to think of each line as a separate entity. You cannot have a style applied across a line break and you will have to close it before the line ends.

== Directive ==

A directive is a line starting with an exclamation point (**!**). Its syntax is like this:
> !<directive_name> arguments of the directive, altough they could be optional

<directive_name>, as the name suggests, stands for the name of the directive, which can be optionally followed by another line of text.
Not all planned directives have been implemented yet, so this is open to change.
You *shouldn't* have to type directive names in lower case, but I think this might be the case for now, until it gets fixed.
Where you write a directive doesn't matter, unless otherwise noted.
All directives are mandatory, unless otherwise noted.

List of directives:

=== !title <args> ===

This is a mandatory directive and it sets the name of the article. All title directives after the first one will be ignored. <args> **can not be** styled.

=== !contributor <contributor_username> ===

This is not a mandatory directive, as there may be articles where a contributor doesn't want to show their username. There can be multiple of these in a single page.
If you get a warning, it means that the username is not present inside [[https://github.com/SpikyTater/spud-wiki/blob/main/src/contributors.js this file]].
You can use both the displayed and the twitch username, the parser will do the rest for you. Capitalization doesn't matter. Incorrect contributor directives will be ignored.

=== !note<note_name> <note_text> ===

It is used in combination with the note ref aggregate to write a note for anything inside the article.
Be careful, as there must be no spaces between !note and <note_name>.
The name of the note doesn't need to be a number. The order in which note directives are written is ignored, in favor of placing them in order of note reference appearance inside the text.
If a note has no references inside the text, it will not be displayed.
<note_name> does not need to be a number, it can be any text, as long as it's not style and has no spaces in it.
In <note_text> you can write using any aggregate you want, as long as you keep everything in a single line.

=== !center_title ===

It tells the engine to center the title of the article.

=== !make_blue_red ===

It writes BlueStrategosJ's username in red inside the contributors' footer.

== Blockquote ==

Blockquotes are started via a '>' at the beginning of a line and end with a new line.
Multiple blockquote lines adjacent to each other are merged in a single one.
Blockquotes look like this:
> Here. It's nice, innit?
> Ohh multiple lines as well!
> This is great, not gonna lie.

== Aggregates ==

Aggregates are a way to style what otherwise would be simple text. They consist of a beginning token and an ending token which, unless otherwise noted, are the same. Different types of aggregates can be put inside one another.
Aggregates **cannot** carry over a line break.

List of aggregates:

=== Italic ===

"Wel\*l, hello th\*ere." will render as "Wel*l, hello th*ere."

=== Bold ===

"Wel\*\*l, hello th\*\*ere." will render as "Wel**l, hello th**ere."

=== Strikethrough ===

"Wel\#\#l, hello th\#\#ere." will render as "Wel##l, hello th##ere."

=== Headings ===

Headings are also used to mark different sections of a page. Once it is implemented, on desktop they will appear inside the article navigation map on the right panel.

There are 5 types of usable headings, from 2 to 6, in order of decreasing importance.
Heading 1 is actually the title of the page, and there can only be one of it.

They can be used like this:

> \=\=\= Headings \=\=\=

This is how the heading of this section, a heading3, has been written in this page.
The number of '=' is the heading number.

== Links ==

=== Internal links ===

To add a link to an article use this syntax:

> \[link_to_article | optional label\]


Their syntax is the same as the one of external links, except they only use a single \[ to open and a single \] to close the aggregate.
There can be no styles inside this aggregate.

Example:

> \[larry|          Label to Larryyyyyyy!!!!!\]

will render as:

> [larry | Label to Larryyyyyyy!!!!!]

=== External Links ===

To add a link to an external resource use this syntax:

> \[\[link_to_page optional label of link\]\]

For example:

> \[\[https://www.twitch.tv/pearlescentmoon click me pls\]\]

will render as [[https://www.twitch.tv/pearlescentmoon click me pls]].
There can be no styles inside this aggregate.

=== Embedded images ===

To embed an image inside an article, first you have to make sure that it's already on the server. To do so, check the '[[https://github.com/SpikyTater/spud-wiki/tree/main/src/media src/media]]' directory on github for the image, and then, to get the ID of that resource, check the file '[[https://github.com/SpikyTater/spud-wiki/blob/main/src/media_assets.js src/media_assets.js']] on github: you will have to check a variable named 'MEDIA_ASSETS'.

The syntax is like this:

> \[\[\[image_id | percentage | position | label \]\]\]

[[[logo     left |30|   This is Larry. Say hi to him.]]]
where image_id is the ID of the resource; percentage is an integer number representing what percentage of the width of the article will be occupied by the image, it's optional and the default value is 30; position is either 'right' or 'left' and it's self-explanatory, it's optional and the default value is 'right'; label is the label you want underneath the image, it's optional and the default value is the description found in src/media_assets.js'.
The order doesn't matter, as long as image_id is written first.
There can be no styles inside this aggregate.

Example:

> \[\[\[logo     left |30|   This is Larry. Say hi to him.\]\]\]

will render as:

Yes, spaces also don't matter. And the place where it appears is also very [abork | aborked]. I will work on that soon.

== Backslash ==

The backslash, \\, is used to strip the meaning out of the following special character. For example if you write

> \\\*

you will simply get a \*.
To get an actual backslash in the page, you will have to write two consecutive backslashes, \\\\.
A single backslash in spudtext currently gives a critical error. It will later be changed to a warning and it wil be ignored.
