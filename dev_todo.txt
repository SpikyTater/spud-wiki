rework navigation
what could go on the right side of the middle section -> page navigation, precomputed and presented as html
site map on the left side
add last modified on the bottom of every page unless !nolastmodified
add recent changes to main page
add redirected from ?redirect=#DeathForTheSpiders -> escape space # " < > [ \ ] ^ `
use html elements -> small, sub, sup, hgroup (for redirect), main, button, footer, header, address (for contributors), abbr
add ARIA for accessibility
add !category and !tag, pretty self explanatory
add a decent site map to the left sidebar
redesign the welcome page
for larry's sake add some testing, especially to spudtext.js (which needs a lot of it)
cleanup spudtext.js, most of it is extremely redundant
add // and /**/ comments to spudtext
once !nosearchindex and !redirect get added, add !nosearchindex to Sup Face and maybe add some easter eggs for it, like 4 random characters that appear between sup and face, and idk how to search index for it
license the SpudText format
add warning for weird characters like microsoft word's ' " ", god I hate these
add about.html page
add some way to prettify spudtext in VS Code
make a bulletin board for todo stuff
make a list of accepted domains for external links, and only https protocol (can be omitted in links)
avoid any possibility of HTML injection by escaping string before adding them inside htmlifystring. same thing for !noteXXXXX, escape the XXXXX part
decouple TokenInstance from AstNode functionality, TokenInstance extend AstNode
editor: add save (never autosave), multiple save slots, squiggles for warnings (yellow) and errors (red), auto compile -> race between 10 seconds since last compilation, 2 seconds debounce, normal click, click on warning/error to show exact place in spudtext (select that substring as well maybe?), better issue (warning/error) console, add prettify function, hide all spudtext documentation in <details> and <summary>
search: add arrow key support to choose result, hide search thingy when focusing out of it / clicking elsewhere
add global constants to spudtext, for example COMMIT_HASH and other stuff
for last_modified of each page, use git instead of the file's last_modified. don't use bigint in stat anymore
!redirect: make it work for every heading
