rework navigation
what could go on the right side of the middle section -> page navigation, preomputed and presented as html
site map on the left side
search functionality
chat commands (!cowboy, !time, !celtic, !kawaii and so on) in the search bar
add last modified on the bottom of every page unless !nolastmodified
add recent changes to main page
add redirected from ?redirect=#DeathForTheSpiders -> escape space # " < > [ \ ] ^ `
use html elements -> small, sub, sup, textarea, hgroup (for redirect), main, button, footer, header, address (for contributors), abbr
add ARIA for accessibility
404.html
mobile layout
a single '#' is used too much (hashtags) to be able to be used as the beginning of strikethrough. use 2#
add h3 to h6, you lazy smile
add embold, you lazy smile
add internal links, you lazy smile
add embedded media (at least images), you lazy smile
add !redirect -> when searching the following string, users will be redirected to this page, to be more specific they will be redirected to the first heading node encountered when going in reverse post-order in the AST (remember to turn the title into a heading1_aggregate, first...). multiple !redirect s are allowed for each heading
add !nosearchindex -> the first heading encountered when going reverse post-order in the AST won't be indexed by its name. redirects are still allowed.
add !category and !tag, pretty self explanatory
add editor where users can try writing an article and see it converted immediately (debounce for like 100 ms, remember to add contain to the CSS of the preview). articles can be saved in local storage, exported or imported. maybe later add more than one save slot for articles.
directives do_center_title should be handled inside spudtext, as it changed something inside the content
cleanup themes
cleanup contributors
handle additional css files and js files added for special pages
add !command directive, to say that, for example, the article "!title kawaii ..etc" you've been writing is the resulting page for a search box command
add article map (stickied maybe?) to the right sidebar
add a decent site map to the left sidebar
style better the darn footer, it looks terrible
style better the darn header, it looks terrible
redesign the welcome page
see if index.js can be cleaned up somehow
for larry's sake add some testing, especially to spudtext.js (which needs a lot of it)
cleanup spudtext.js, most of it is extremely redundant
